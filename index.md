# Blargh!
That's what this is. It's the start of my Blargh.

### Objectives
What are my goals?
- After the lessons and reading from each chapter, I would like to write a blog post attempting to digest and re-explain some of the material. I would like to discuss how I believe it affects my understanding of AI and its possibilities as I progress through this course.
- I have a project in mind, and I'd like a living record of my work toward accomplishing this task. (Grand Champ!)

### The Project
Rocket League Grand Champ Bot. That about sums it up. 

I can use Rocket League in a variety of ways as I progress through this course. I plan to, for example, base my CH2 image-classification project around classifying Rocket League cars. Not sure where I'll go from there specifically, because I haven't looked at the next project yet! I'll be sure to let you know. In general, in my complete ignorance of what's ahead of me, I would like to train a number of specific skills into models to combine into a supermodel or something, possibly such as: 
- Get to ball fast as possible and smash with directional intent
- Learn to dribble with exceptional vector control
- Train defense/blocking skills
- Somehow define variety of skills defined above as various "strategies"
- Use those models/strategies as inputs into another model that combines those strategies to itself.
- Expand on these principles and GAN.
